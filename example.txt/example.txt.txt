Abstract
The cyberfraud techniques emerged as a significant threat to the banking sector in Nigeria. Bank customers have been losing their hard-earned funds to these measures due to a lack of sufficient awareness of the cyberfraud tactics and preventive measures. There has been an increased rate of loss recorded annually in the banking sector due to fraud. The banking sector in Nigeria recorded a loss to a tune amount of â‚¦17.6bn in 2023 amount higher than the budget allocation for education in most states of the country. Social engineering remains the persistent and predominant technique fraudsters employ to defraud bank customers in Nigeria. Phishing, identity theft, login credential theft, ATM card swap, and skimming are other techniques cybercriminals employ. This research paper aims to examine and analyze the modus operandi of these techniques and explore the strategic preventive measures that can be implemented by customers to mitigate these risks, such as using advanced cybersecurity technologies, multi-factor authentication systems, employee training, as well as regulatory controls. The paper highlights the significance of a proactive and adaptive cybersecurity posture, continuous monitoring, and collaboration with regulatory bodies to enhance the resilience of the banking sector against cyber threats. The research focuses more on cyberfrauds targeting bank customers, and secondary data will be used for research purposes.
